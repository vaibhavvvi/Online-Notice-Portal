# Online-Notice-Portal
This portal will help school and colleges to forward notices to specified persons
This project was carried out to design online notice portals for universities. For example there are four users of this portal then they can view, issue, delete, edit notices depending upon their accessibility.
Before logging in everyone has to signup on the portal.
A faculty can issue notice to students, students can view it after logging in so here students are only allowed to view the notices. Dean or Head of Department can issue notices to both students and faculties. Similarly administrator can issue notices to all. Users issuing notices are also allowed to delete, edit notices.
This portal also allows to send notices to specific users if needed.
